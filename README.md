# Airbnb Toronto - Data Science Applied Project
In the field of data science, the ability to craft sound recommendations and propose business strategies based on small or large data sets is essential. In this project, I work through a full data cycle to verify data, develop visualizations, and construct predictive analytics visualizations. I perform exploration, analysis and prediction processes while using appropriate visualization, reporting techniques and best practices to present findings and recommendations to stakeholders.

## Achievements
- Identified features in a Toronto Airbnb dataset that are predictive of price and review scores enabling stakeholders to develop business strategies to emphasize these features when providing Airbnb service to existing and potential customers
- Performed exploratory data analysis, outlier detection, imputation of missing values for both categorical and numerical features, feature engineering, and dummy coding categorical variables
- Web scraped the former city/borough names of Toronto to group over 70 neighbourhoods into six cities in preparation for modeling and visualizations
- Created a Tableau dashboard to visualize rental property features that affect customer satisfaction ratings for Toronto Airbnb listings. This helps the host improve their service, shape their reputation, increase the satisfaction of customers and generate more revenue
