# Data Science Applied Project - Airbnb Toronto
In the field of data science, the ability to craft sound recommendations and propose business strategies based on small or large data sets is essential. In this project, I work through a full data cycle to verify data, develop visualizations, and construct predictive analytics visualizations. I perform exploration, analysis and prediction processes while using appropriate visualization, reporting techniques and best practices to present findings and recommendations to stakeholders.
